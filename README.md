## Useful for cloning webpages

* Grabs the html of the current webpage
* Injects the HTML `base` tag into the `<head>` so that links/css/image/javascript come from original source
* Useful for demonstrating ease of creating phishing sites

## Install and usage
1. If not on a teacher laptop where it should already be installed, go to the GitHub link, download the zip file. 
2. Then in Chrome, go to extensions, check the box for 'Developer Mode', then load the unpacked extension. This will put a stormtrooper icon in your extensions.
3. Check that it works by navigating to a website and clicking the strormtrooper icon. A pop-up should appear with a flat text file containing HTML code.
